# Numbers Guessing Games

WORK IN PROGRESS: The exercise for the Dev You Java 3 class was a simple number guessing game, integers 1 to 100.

But one of my classmates, E, asked the instructors to be more specific than "numbers." That gave me the idea that maybe 
there can be guessing games for other types of numbers, like fractions.

The games are in the `games` package.
